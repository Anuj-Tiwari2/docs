# OpenPower Firmware Documentation #

This repository will contain all documentation for the [OpenPower](http://openpowerfoundation.org/) open source software
that's being released to support the POWER ecosystem.

As always is the case with documentation, it usually needs some updates.  So feel free to do it yourself :) or touch
base with us on the mailing lists.
