Host golden-side boot
=====================

OpenPOWER systems may have support for a "golden side" of firmware in the PNOR.
This is a second copy of firmware binaries and configuration, used
only in a recovery situation.

This is a separate mechanism for a golden-side image for any BMC implementation,
but does rely on the BMC to manage booting to the second copy of firmware.

How it works
------------

With current OpenPOWER implementations, the boot process has a little
functionality to manage the golden side boot. The BMC maintains a "boot count"
variable. This is initially set to a fairly low integer (2 for current
implementations), and is decremented when the BMC starts the boot sequence. The
boot count is exposed as a discrete IPMI sensor, and can be accessed with the
Get Sensor Reading / Set Sensor Reading IPMI commands.

Once the system has reached a user-accessible state (ie. petitboot), the boot
count is reset (again, to 2 in current implementations).

In cases where the system is booting properly, the boot count should only vary
between N and N-1. The boot count sensor is available as a discrete IPMI sensor.

If booting continually fails, the system firmware will not reach a point where
the boot count is reset, and the boot count value will reach zero.

If the system is booted in a condition where boot count is zero, the BMC
will perform a boot sequence that causes the firmware to be loaded from the
"golden side" of PNOR - generally a second copy of the firmware code present
at a higher address.

Querying BMC state
------------------

For OpenPOWER machines with an external IPMI interface to the BMC,
query the 'Golden Side' and 'Boot Count' sensors (output trimmed for
brevity):

  [jk@openpower]$ ipmitool [â€¦] sensor list | grep '\(Golden Side\|Boot Count\)'
  BMC Golden Side  | 0x0        | discrete   | 0x0080| na        |
  BIOS Golden Side | 0x0        | discrete   | 0x0080| na        |
  Boot Count       | 0x0        | discrete   | 0x0280| na        |

As these are a discrete sensors, the value is given by the high byte of the
assertion state, in the forth column. Here we see that the golden
side - for both BMC and host - is 0, and the boot count is 2. This is
the regular machine state.

Querying Host state
-------------------

From the host, we can also determine which side we were actually used for the
current boot, using device tree properties under the PNOR device.

For a machine booted in regular state:
  
  [jk@openpower ~]$ cd \
     /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/xscom@3fc0000000000/isa@b0020/pnor@fc000000
  [jk@openpower pnor@fc000000]$ lsprop *-tocs
  active-image-tocs
  		 00000000 01ff8000
  alternate-image-tocs
  		 02000000 (33554432)
  golden-image-tocs
  		 02000000 (33554432)

These 'tocs' properties describe locations of table-of-contents sections
in the PNOR image. The 'active-image-tocs' describes the TOC (and
possibly a backup TOC) that we used for this boot. In this case, we
are using the TOC at address 0x00000000 of the PNOR flash image.

The 'alternate-image-tocs' property describes potential alternate images.
Here we have one at 32MB (0x02000000).

We also see the golden TOC described in the 'golden-image-tocs' property,
referencing a TOC at 32MB.

Using these three properties, we can see that we booted from the "working"
PNOR firmware image, and there was another image available at 32MB. This
other image is the golden side.
